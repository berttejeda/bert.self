Systems Administration/Orchestration, and everything that ships with
DevOps methodoligies, which includes 
Desired State and Configuration Management, 
among other buzzwordy terms.

## My tech stack

I absolutely love [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) 
and am forever a student of programming 
languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/),
[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/),
[Go](https://go.dev/),
and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

For shell scripting on POSIX-compliant systems, 
I mostly use [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 
and [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), 
but I can get pretty crafty on Windows with 
[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) and even
[BATCH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file).

My Web skills include:

- Frontend Development
    - [React](https://reactjs.org/), 
    - [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
    - Good ol' [javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) 
- Backend/API Development
    - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)
    - [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

My goto for infrastructure orchestration and platform tooling is 
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). 

For Infrastructure as Code (IaC), 
I use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Microservices and Virtualization? Oh yeah!:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Rancher](https://rancher.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Ovirt](https://www.ovirt.org/)/[RHEV](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/virtualization/enterprise-virtualization)
- [ProxMox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/)
- [VMware](https://www.vmware.com)

But wait, there's more: 

I'm all about that [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and I love, love, love these 
Atlassian Products:

- [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
- [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
